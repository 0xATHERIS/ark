  The Dialog component is a powerful and highly customizable tool for creating
  dialog windows, also known as modals, in your application. It includes
  essential elements such as triggers, content, and close triggers.
---

## Usage

Begin by importing the necessary components from the package:

```tsx
import {
  Dialog,
  DialogBackdrop,
  DialogCloseTrigger,
  DialogContainer,
  DialogContent,
  DialogDescription,
  DialogPresence,
  DialogTitle,
  DialogTrigger,
  Portal,
} from '@ark-ui/react'
```

Here is a basic example:

<Story name="Basic" />

## Controlled Dialog

To create a controlled Dialog component, manage the state of the dialog using
the `open` and `onClose` props:

<Story name="Controlled" />

## Using Render Function

The Dialog component supports the use of a render function as a child for more
control. This allows access to dialog states like `isOpen`:

<Story name="RenderFn" />

## Adding Animations

To create a Dialog with animated components, wrap the Dialog elements inside the
`DialogPresence` component:

<Story name="Animated" />

## Conclusion

The Dialog component provides a feature-rich interface for creating dialog
windows in your applications. It provides flexibility through a variety of props
and configurations, accommodating different design requirements and use cases.
From simple modals to complex, state-controlled dialogs, the Dialog component is
a versatile tool in a developer's toolkit.
